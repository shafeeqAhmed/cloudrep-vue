                    The Future of Work is upon us and the traditional workforce is being disrupted. Displaced workers,
                    underemployed youth, and gig economy workers are all struggling to find good quality work that pays
                    a livable wage. There is a growing gig economy where people are working short-term jobs or
                    freelancing to make ends meet. The problem is that these gigs are often low-paying and donâ€™t offer
                    any benefits or job security.
